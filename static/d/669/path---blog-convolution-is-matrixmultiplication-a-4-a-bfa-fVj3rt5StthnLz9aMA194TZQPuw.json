Now thinking about it - convolution is just a 2d dot product - can we all have a vote to call convolution matrix dot product? If we call an operation between two matrices that does a <strong>multiplication followed by summation</strong> through collapsing one dimension <strong>matrix \"multiplication\"</strong> - we should really call an operation between two matrices that does a <strong>dot product followed by summation</strong> through collapsing one dimension <strong>matrix \"dot product\"</strong> - it's only fair?! Do I sound crazy?</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"convolution-is-matrixmultiplication"}}
