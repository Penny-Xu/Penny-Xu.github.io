This means that networks that first applies convolutional layers, and then applies fully connected linear layers, can be made fully convolutional. Or in other words, a MLP can be represented by convolution layers only.</p>\n<p>Now this was news to me because I always thought linear layers and convolutional layers to be different, with different input types, weights, and outputs, as well as the idea that convolution is meant to do feature extraction, while fully connected layers is meant to do classification.</p>\n<p>However, linear and convolutional layers are almost identical functionally as both layers simply computes dot products. The only difference is that the neurons in the convolution layers are connected to a local region and that parameters may be shared. Therefore, it is very easy to convert fully connected layers to convolutional layers.</p>\n<h2>Fully Connected Layer</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/line-709b7dd2c0ed5442ff5242050f3eb2b6.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Convolution Layer</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/conv-66500ecf6af31953e382e08be95e3b33.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Why is it useful?</h2>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"full-convolution"}}
