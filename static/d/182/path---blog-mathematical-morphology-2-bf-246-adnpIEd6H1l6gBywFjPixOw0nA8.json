In image processing, operators from mathematical morphology can be used to pre-process or post-process images. The basic four morphological operators are dilation, erosion, opening, and closing. All operations involve an <strong>structuring element</strong>, and the result of each operation really describes the interaction between the input image and the structuring element. These operations are also usually performed for binary images. </p>\n<p>In the examples below, the structuring element is 3 pixels by 3 pixels. You can think of it as a filter or kernel, similar to convolution. An <em>anchor</em> is defined for each structuring element that maps to each pixels of the output.</p>\n<p>In the visualizations below, the left image is the input image, and the right image is the output as the filter is slid across. Each box represents a pixel. An orange pixel represents a pixel in the foreground, while a grey pixel is part of the background. The final output is displayed when the structuring element has slid through all the output pixels.</p>\n<h2>Dilation</h2>\n<p>This operation \"dilates\" the shape in the image.</p>\n<p>Wrules:</p>\n<p>*\n*\n*</p>\n<p><img src=\"/dialate-d6ec2fc1995eeeb95b917db2c6e1cea0.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Erosion</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/erode-b4f8cd8e2ed187ab5ae45f3b8134b940.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Opening</h2>\n<p>First apply erosion, then apply dilation!</p>\n<h2>Closing</h2>\n<p>First apply dilation, then apply erosion!</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"mathematical-morphology"}}
