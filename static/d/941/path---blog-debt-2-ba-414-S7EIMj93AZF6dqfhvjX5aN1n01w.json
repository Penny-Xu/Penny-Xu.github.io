{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Big Debt Crisis Analysis","date":"2020-04-20","tags":["random"]},"html":"<p>Working for aprox. half a year, still amidst adjusting to working full time, and BAM, I am told we are in an economic crisis. Great timing. I have come to the realization that the four years of college absolutely did NOT prepare me for having some understanding of the current economic / financial conditions and prospectives (and yes, I took micro and macro economics - don't remember much if at all).</p>\n<p>Are we in a recession, a depression? Stock market crashed, but theres a v shaped recovery so everything is ok? What does negative interest rate mean? US seems to be in debt, how does that affect me? Why can the fed keep printing money for stimulus, quantitive easing, and potential universal basic income? Will this cause inflation? And more importantly, what should I do to navigate this potential recession. These are the questions that I wish I could answer as an \"adult,\" but I am more confused than ever. The idea of not understanding the current state is even scarier than not knowing the future.</p>\n<p>I decided that rewatching the movie The Big Short to prepare for this crisis will not cut it. This is why I picked up <strong>Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises</strong> by Ray Dalio.</p>\n<p>I find the way this book present the information very straight forward, no fluff, the way it goes about describing the phases of the debt cycle almost algorithmic. This post is really for me, jogging down some key points and notes under the two main sections of deflationary vs inflationary debt cycle. However, if you are a tech person reading this and you are as oblivious to the economy / financial just like me, then I hope you can get something out of this. In the end, I would like to draw some parallels to what is happening today to the debt cycle template because there does not seem to be a 1:1 mapping to either the deflationary nor the inflationary case presented.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>deflationary debt cycle</li>\n<li>inflationary debt cycle</li>\n<li>monetary policies</li>\n<li>analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The classic deflationary debt cycle</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In deflationary depressions, policy makers respond to the initial economic contraction by lowering interest rates. But when interest rates reach about 0 percent, that lever is no longer an effective way to stimulate the economy. Debt restructuring and austerity dominate, without being balanced by adequate stimulation (especially money printing and currency depreciation). In this phase, debt burdens (debt and debt service as a percent of income) rise, because incomes fall faster than restructuring, debt paydowns reduce the debt stock, and many borrowers are required to rack up still more debts to cover those higher interest costs. As noted, deflationary depressions typically occur in countries where most of the unsustainable debt was financed domestically in local currency, so that the eventual debt bust produces forced selling and defaults, but not a currency or a balance of payments problem.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Causes:</strong> investor optimism, bull run / market boom, over leverage, increasing debt to income (depends if concentrated in one sector or averaged out), failure of monetary policies to stop the trend and often they encourage it, because who wants to be the party pooper</p>\n<p><strong>Cases:</strong> US (1928 - 1937)</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Phase</th>\n<th>Central Bank / Government Should Do This</th>\n<th>Don't Do This</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bubble</td>\n<td>restrain debt growth, tighten fiscal policies</td>\n<td>speculators over leverage, debt financed investments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Top</td>\n<td>use macroprutential policies to constrict bubble</td>\n<td>tighten after bubble burst</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Depression</td>\n<td>lower shorts, aggressive monetization, provide liquidity, provide stimulus, protect important institutions</td>\n<td>austerity, slow to action</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deleverage</td>\n<td>balance the depressive forces of defaults and austerity with the reflationary forces of debt monetization, currency declines, and fiscal stimulus.

When those foreign capital flows slow, credit creation turns into credit contraction. In an inflationary deleveraging, capital withdrawal dries up lending and liquidity at the same time that currency declines produce inflation. Inflationary depressions in which a lot of debt\nis denominated in foreign currency are especially difficult to manage because policy makers’ abilities to spread out the pain are more limited.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Causes:</strong> currency weakness. not reserved currency aka dollars, low foreign exchange reserves, foreign debt, increase in deficit, capital flight</p>\n<p><strong>Cases:</strong> Germany post WWI (1918 - 1924)</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adjustments</th>\n<th>Central Bank / Government Should Do This</th>\n<th>Don't Do This</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>manage currency</td>\n<td>surprise devaluation of currency, huge drop so ppl think its the bottom</td>\n<td>dragged out devaluation, maket speculation worse to come causing high interest rates and inflation expectation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>external balance</td>\n<td>incentivize investors to stay in currency</td>\n<td>restrict capital outflow through regulation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>smooth downturn</td>\n<td>use reserved to slow down foreign capital withdrawal</td>\n<td>use reserve sales for spending</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>managing bad debt</td>\n<td>work through debt and make up gap with credit</td>\n<td>allow disorderly defaults causing uncertainly and capital flight</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Monetary policies</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>lower interest rates: affects behavior of borrowers and spenders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>create positive wealth effects (raise value of most investments), makes it easier to borrow aka buy things on credit (raise demand), reduce debt burdens (improve cash flow / spending).

While they are much less likely to have inflationary contractions that are as severe, they can have inflationary depressions, though they emerge more slowly and later in the deleveraging process, after a sustained and repeated overuse of stimulation to reverse deflationary deleveraging. Any country, including one with a reserve currency, can experience some movement out of its currency, which changes the severity of the trade-off between inflation and growth described earlier. If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for its currency, erode its reserve currency status (e.g., make investors view it as less of a store hold of wealth), and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Bayesian classifier is a probabilistic classifier where the decision boundary is determined by the intersection of two distributions. The quality of this classifier greatly depends on the assumptions that we make, such as the type of distribution (most commonly Gaussian), the type of covariance matrix (if they are the same for all classes), and the priors (was my training data randomly sampled). As you can see from the quatric decision boundary vs. the linear boundary, the quatric classifies the grey point as class red while the linear classifies it as class blue. So when we make these assumptions, we need to ask our selves if the tradeoff in complexity is worth it since these assumptions influences the results of the classifier. However, even with these simplified probabilistic assumptions, Bayesian classifier work remarkably well in practice. I believe the reason Bayesian classifier does well in applications is that it is simple and intuitive, as shown by my friend's intuition, where the decision boundary is simply an equation that combines the means, covariances, and the priors of the two classes!</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"debt"}}
