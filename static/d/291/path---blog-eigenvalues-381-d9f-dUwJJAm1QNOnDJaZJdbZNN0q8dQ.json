Have you ever solved for one, but didn't know what you were solving? Well, this post is clearly for you!</p>\n<p>First of all, eigenvalue and eigenvector always sounded intimidating for me, and I think I know why now. It's because eigenvalue/eigenvector combines german and english, so it always sounded like a proper noun with no meaning. But actually, <em>eigen</em> means special or unique in German. So all this time, you have been solving these special little snow-, I mean special values and special vectors. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"eigenvalues"}}
