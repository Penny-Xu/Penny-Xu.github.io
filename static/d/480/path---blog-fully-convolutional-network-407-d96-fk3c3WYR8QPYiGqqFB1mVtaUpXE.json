We will look at the main idea and general structures of a fully connected network or commonly known as a Multilayer Perception, a convolution with fully connected network, and finally a fully convolutional network. These three types of networks shows the evolution of architectures used in image classification, with increasing improvements in results. I find the use of fully convolutional network for semantic segmentation a very cool topic so I will focus on that in this post. I hope that you will see that a fully convolutional network is really a build-on to earlier models.</p>\n<h2>Fully Connected Network</h2>\n<h2>Convolution + Fully Connected Network</h2>\n<h2>Fully Convolutional Network</h2>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"fully-convolutional-network"}}
